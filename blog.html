                really. There are
                popular agile methodologies, ie frameworks and pre-packaged
                life
                cycles that claim to provide varying levels of agility to organizations that use them, your mileage
                will vary. But
                there is no one agile methodology. <br> <br>

                Agile is best defined as a set of values and principles, as a body of knowledge that is based on those
                values
                and principles, and most importantly as a community of practitioners who are passionate about
                changing the
                way we work, moving out of the dark ages of industrial era thinking and towards a more
                progressive mindset. <br><br>

                So if agile is not a concrete methodology does that mean it isn't useful, that agile is not practical?
                Not at all. while the reality is that there is no such thing as a standard agile methodology, we
                can
                easily define agile in
                concrete terms.

                A common definition, one many people use in industry often use is to refer to Agile as the the
                collection of
                practices, principles, and concepts that were inspired by the Agile Manifesto, a body of
                knowledge that lays
                out a team-centric, iterative approach to delivering value using customer feedback
                and continuous experimentation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white text-padding-area">Thus defined Agile comes in many
                flavours and methodologies—for instance, scrum, Kanban, SAFe, and
                Extreme Programming—and while they differ in their specifics, they are all based on a standard set of

                principles.
                <br>


                A more straightforward definition of Agile is that Agile is a strategy to help organizations that face
                increasing
                market uncertainty by forming self-managing teams that have the autonomy to decide how value is created

                for their customers, enabling those teams to achieve their outcomes through intimate, direct, and
                frequent
                market contact. <br>
                <br>


                We can also define Agile as a mindset, a collection of things we value, beliefs we hold, and the
                behaviours
                we
                can observe. ' beliefs and behaviours about our people, customers, and work. I am very liberally riffing
                on
                concepts found in the book, The Agile Mindset by Gil Broza. The result has significantly impacted how I

                discuss Agile thinking with others. It will have an equally positive impact on you as well. The outcome
                is
                a
                description of an agile mindset that is fit for purpose in our context.
                As we agree on what agile means, we can perform the vital work of defining our organizational
                identity,
                establishing our context, and growing the structure required to enable agility.

                If we take a look at the history of organizations and their supporting management systems, it
                becomes
                clear that
                the vast majority of organizations are based on a model that became popular over a 100 years ago.

                Most organizations manage through centralized control, authority, deep nested hierarchy, standards to be
                followed, scaling through bureaucracy, armies of managers because that was how organizations
                functioned during

                the indiustrial revolution. <br><br>

                Waterfall development is an example of industrial management thinking applied to software delivery and
                project
                delivery in general. Waterfall asks us to plan the entire project up front regardless of how big that
                project is. In
                waterfall we design everything before we build our solution, we build the entire solution before we test
                it, and we
                test everything before it goes out to market. Work is handed off across specialists. The way we work is
                prescribed
                by people who don't do the work, and governed by people who are often separate from the workers as well.

            <p class="text-white text-padding-area">
                The problem with this big batch, command and control approach is that we are no longer in the industrial
                era.
                We are in the era of complexity. Product cycles are short, markets are diverse, and accelerated change
                is the
                only constant. To thrive in an environment of rapid uncertainty, we cant wait for a bunch of bosses to
                make
                descisions, we need the people who are on the ground doing the work to be able to make the key
                decisions.
                We need those people to work closely with their users and get feedback as fast as possible. <br><br>

                We need those people to operate with a sense of ownership. We need people to feel safe to
                experiment, trusted to be authentic in their opinion. We need intense collaboration, and we
                teamwork. Humanistic management approached emphasize values, principles and practices that promote a
                working environment
                based on establishing and operating autonomous teams that are motivated to deliver exceptional value
                and
                making the world a better place. Agile is an example of humanistic management, and provides practices
                that
                in many cases are diametrically opposed to waterfall and other traditional approaches. Agile is designed
                for
                the modern era of volatility and uncertainty.

                way
                that maximizes
                transparency and collaboration. <br><br>

                When that team can establish market intimacy through frequent feedback and co-creation with real users
                and other market actors, and when that team is granted the autonomy to constantly experiment,
                iterate, learn and adjust what they work on and how they work. <br><br>

                Agile does not mean scrum, safe or any other fixed method. These are (somewhat problematic) examples of

                Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as an agile project lifecycle.

                That is because the idea of a project is only necessary when your organization is made up of disparate
                functional departments that require a project to glue everyone together to an outcome.

                While organizations starting down the agile road may start by agilifying their projects, it is better to
                think of agile as the act of standing up a persistent, stable and self-organizing team responsible
                for the set of outcomes or overarching mission.

                In this sense, a project is not required to bring people together to deliver. Rather we have an
                investment and the will to bring a team together to bring that investment to bear.

                Agile does have a value life cycle. While this value life cycle will be described differently depending
                on who you ask, the context, etc., we can infer some steps and states that are reasonable in many
                cases: <br><br>

                <b class="coming-color">• Gathering Insight - </b> Getting as close to your customers as you can to

                changed business models that can realize organizational outcomes. <br>

                <b class="coming-color">• Solution Discovery - </b> Deeper design, prototyping, problem /solution fit
                interviews, solutioning activities for the next increment of value you want to deliver to your market
                <br>

                <b class="coming-color">• Delivery - </b> Building and testing your solution using an iterative and
                incremental approach. <br>

                <b class="coming-color">• Learning - </b> Validating whether your solution resulted in the expected
                change in user behaviour, whether your solution had the expected economic impact, deciding whether to
